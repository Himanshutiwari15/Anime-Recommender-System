5114,Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood,"""In order for something to be obtained, something of equal value must be lost."" Alchemy is bound by this Law of Equivalent Exchange—something the young brothers Edward and Alphonse Elric only realize after attempting human transmutation: the one forbidden act of alchemy. They pay a terrible price for their transgression—Edward loses his left leg, Alphonse his physical body. It is only by the desperate sacrifice of Edwards right arm that he is able to affix Alphonses soul to a suit of armor. Devastated and alone, it is the hope that they would both eventually return to their original bodies that gives Edward the inspiration to obtain metal limbs called ""automail"" and become a state alchemist, the Fullmetal Alchemist. Three years of searching later, the brothers seek the Philosophers Stone, a mythical relic that allows an alchemist to overcome the Law of Equivalent Exchange. Even with military allies Colonel Roy Mustang, Lieutenant Riza Hawkeye, and Lieutenant Colonel Maes Hughes on their side, the brothers find themselves caught up in a nationwide conspiracy that leads them not only to the true nature of the elusive Philosophers Stone, but their countrys murky history as well. In between finding a serial killer and racing against time, Edward and Alphonse must ask themselves if what they are doing will make them human again... or take away their humanity.",64,Spring 2009,"Action, Military, Adventure, Comedy, Drama, Magic, Fantasy, Shounen",R - 17+ (violence & profanity),9.25,737295,1.0,4,1206202,107403,https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/anime/5/47421.jpg,in order for something to be obtained something of equal value must be lost alchemy is bound by this law of equivalent exchange—something the young brothers edward and alphonse elric only realize after attempting human transmutation: the one forbidden act of alchemy they pay a terrible price for their transgression—edward loses his left leg alphonse his physical body it is only by the desperate sacrifice of edwards right arm that he is able to affix alphonses soul to a suit of armor devastated and alone it is the hope that they would both eventually return to their original bodies that gives edward the inspiration to obtain metal limbs called automail and become a state alchemist the fullmetal alchemist three years of searching later the brothers seek the philosophers stone a mythical relic that allows an alchemist to overcome the law of equivalent exchange even with military allies colonel roy mustang lieutenant riza hawkeye and lieutenant colonel maes hughes on their side the brothers find themselves caught up in a nationwide conspiracy that leads them not only to the true nature of the elusive philosophers stone but their countrys murky history as well in between finding a serial killer and racing against time edward and alphonse must ask themselves if what they are doing will make them human again or take away their humanity,"action, military, adventure, comedy, drama, magic, fantasy, shounen",r  17+ (violence & profanity)

7193,Aoi Bungaku Series,"The series consists of adaptations of six modern classics of Japanese literature: Osamu Dazais No Longer Human (Ningen Shikkaku)  Run, Melos! (Hashire, Melos!), Natsume Soseki’s Kokoro, Ryunosuke Akutagawa’s Hell Screen (Jigoku Hen)  The Spiders Thread (Kumo no Ito), and Ango Sakaguchis In the Forest, Under Cherries in Full Bloom (Sakura no Mori no Mankai no Shita). No Longer Human (Ningen Shikkaku) - A high school student becomes lost and alienated. Despondent and aimless, he falls into a cycle of self abuse, depression and drugs that taints his life for years. Told in four chapters, each chapter deals with a different point in his life and the final chapter leaves him standing alone - an empty and hollow caricature of his former self. In the Forest, Under Cherries in Full Bloom (Sakura no Mori no Mankai no Shita) - A love story between a 12th-century woman and a mountain bandit who abducts her. Kokoro - A 114 tale of a young mans life journey during the Meiji era. The work deals with the transition from the Japanese Meiji society to the modern era, by exploring the friendship between a young man and an older man he calls ""Sensei"". It continues the theme of isolation developed in Sosekis previous works, here in the context of interwoven strands of egoism and guilt, as opposed to shame. Run, Melos! (Hashire, Melos!) - An updated retelling of a classic Greek tale of the story of Damon and Phidias. The most prominent theme of ""Run, Melos!"" is unwavering friendship. Despite facing hardships, the protagonist Melos does his best to save his friends life, and in the end his efforts are rewarded. The Spiders Thread (Kumo no Ito) - The Buddha Shakyamuni chances to notice a cold-hearted criminal suffering in Hell. But this criminal did perform one single act of kindness in not stepping on a spider in a forest. Moved by this selfless act, Shakyamuni takes the silvery thread of a spider in Paradise and lowers it down into Hell, but it falls upon the criminal to seize the opportunity and pull himself out - if he can. Hell Screen (Jigoku Hen) - A famous artist is commissioned by a great lord to create a series of paintings depicting scenes of the ""Buddhist Hell."" The artist is unable to paint scenes that he has not seen himself, prompting him to torture and torment the Lords staff to create his imagined images of hell. His creative efforts taint the household, as the story descends into madness and destruction.

2835,Patalliro!,"Patarillo! is set in a society much like ours in most ways, with one decided twist. The manga on which it is based is one of the much-read works produced for adolescent Japanese girls that features a healthy proportion of gay men and beautiful teenagers aka bishounen (beautiful boys). Most of the action takes place in Marinera, the land of eternal spring, located somewhere in the South Seas. The country is a major producer of diamonds they provide much of the basis of conflict in the anime series. They come from one of the most prolific mines in the world, owned by the king of Marinera, the vertically challenged but horizontally endowed boy-king Patarillo himself. The International Diamond Syndicate - a huge semi- criminal organization/ secret society dedicated to taking over the world`s entire diamond supply- wants that mine and will stop at nothing to get it. In the early episodes they send off a number of bishounen assassins to do in Patarillo, which necessitates his having a bodyguard, the English MI6 agent, Major Jack (`Bishounen-Killer`) Bancoran. Bancoran`s nickname doesn`t mean he shoots bishounen in cold blood. The soubriquet comes from the fact that no male under the age of 17 can resist his sexual fascination. This, to Bancoran`s eternal disgust, includes Patarillo himself. The action switches often from Marinera to MI6 headquarters in London (London seems to be an easy two hour`s flight from the South Seas) or Bancoran`s palatial condo in the suburbs of same. (MI6, be it noted, looks a lot like Fritz Lang`s Metropolis, while Jack`s `apartment` bears a passing resemblance to Randolph Hearst`s spread.) The action also goes into the past and future and out into space. Patarillo evidently gets around.

389,Karas,"The world of the humans and the world of the demons (youkai) have overlapped one another, leaving humans to walk the streets of life as they normally would, while demons walk, hidden from the naked eye, down the very same streets. A seemingly young woman named Yurine and her servant, the Karas (from the Japanese word for ""Crow""), have long maintained order and balance between the overlapped worlds, ultimately keeping the demons from interrupting the lives of humans. However, humans have come to forget and jest at the existence of demons, and no longer understand the privilege it is to live without fear. Disgusted by this arrogance, an old Karas turns his back on the laws he had once upheld, and in his human form, named Eko, he creates an army of Mikura, or mechanized demons, to ready an attack on the human race. A young man named Otoha inherits the powers of the Karas and takes his place at the side of Yurine, who claims that his soul called out for her while he lived the life of a human. They live in the world of the demons. It is now up to Otoha to prove himself as a Karas, and restore the balance that Eko threatens to upset. Meanwhile, a superstitious police officer named Sagisaka and his rational new recruit, Kure, follow the trail of the murders dealt by Ekos Mikura, as well as the trail of a rogue Mikura named Nue.

2608,Wangan Midnight,"Based on a seinen manga by Kusunoki Michiharu serialised in Young Magazine. The story gets its roots from the actual street racing that occurs on Tokyos Shuto Expressway, one stretch of which is known as the ""Wangan"", literally meaning ""bay side"" (although it is generally used to refer to the freeway), the longest, straightest road in the entire country. Of course, theres also lots of traffic to contend with, including a fair number of heavy trucks. Because of this, the action is inherently hazardous, and wrecks are common. Blown engines are also a frequent hazard, especially with the extreme-high power engines. One day, Akio Asakura, a third year high school student, is driving his Fairlady Z (Z1) and is challenged by Tatsuya Shima, a doctor, in his black Porsche 64 Turbo (nicknamed the ""BlackBird""). With a friend in the passenger seat and two girls in the back, Akio pitifully tries to win, but is defeated. Determined to become faster, he goes to the junkyard to buy parts for his car, when he sees a pristine, unscratched midnight blue Fairlady Z (S) in the junkyard. Intrigued as to why such a machine is about to be junked, he buys it. He soon finds that the car is unnaturally fast due to a tuned L28 engine, bored and stroked to .1 liters combined with twin turbos, which produces 62bhp. He also finds that all of the cars previous owners had unfortunate accidents in it, starting with the first owners death. The manga follows Akios various encounters, though the central plot revolves around his constant battle with the BlackBird for superiority.
